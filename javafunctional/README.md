## Introduction

The aim of this project is to show case the differences between Imperative and declarative approach of coding. Another focus is on different functions available in the Stream API as well as some pros and cons of some of these approaches.

## Out Of Scope

Since only basic implementation of various functions from stream API is targeted for this project and the main idea is just to see them in action, unit tests are out of scope.
