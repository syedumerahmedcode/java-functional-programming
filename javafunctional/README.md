## Introduction

The aim of this project is to show case the differences between Imperative and declarative approach of coding. Another focus is on different functions available in the Stream API as well as some pros and cons of some of these approaches.

## Out Of Scope

Since only basic implementation of various functions from stream API is targeted for this project and the main idea is just to see them in action, unit tests are out of scope.

## Explanation Declarative Approach

Our normal approach before Java 8 was to program via Imperative Programming but lambdas work via Declarative programming. 

__Declarative programming:__ Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. In simple words, Declarative Programming is like asking your friend to draw a landscape. You don’t care how they draw it, that’s up to them.

whereas 

__Imperative Programming:__ imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that changes a program's state. In simple words, Imperative Programming is like your friend listening to Bob Ross telling them how to paint a landscape. While good ole Bob Ross isn’t exactly commanding, he is giving them step by step directions to get the desired result.

   
## Explanation Functional Interface

A functional interface is an interface which has exactly one abstract method.

Please note the following from JavaDoc:

Since _default methods_ have an implementation, they are not abstract. If an interface declares an abstract method overriding one of the public methods of java.lang.Object, that also does not count toward the interface's abstract method count since any implementation of the interface will have an implementation from java.lang.Object or elsewhere.
