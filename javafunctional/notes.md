# These are rough notes

- Created a simple maven project.

- My project was not compiling, so I added the properties for _1.8 version_ as indicated in this link: https://facingissuesonit.com/2021/05/08/maven-error-source-option-5-is-no-longer-supported-use-6-or-later/

- A stream allows us to get in an abstract mode where we simple tell it what we want.
